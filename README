NAME
    Data::Dumper::Declare - Data::Dumper, sweetened with Devel::Declare

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Dumper::Declare;
      print Dumper($account_data);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a "Dumper" function much the same as the
    Data::Dumper "Dumper" function, but thanks to a bit of Devel::Declare
    magic, it knows the variable names passed to it, so rather than printing
    something like:

      $VAR1 = {
        balance => 42.00
      };

    It will print:

      $account_data = {
        balance => 42.00
      };

    It can be passed arrays and hashes directly, with no need to create a
    reference to them...

      my @foo = qw(1 2 3);
      print Dumper(@foo);

    will print...

      @foo = (
        1,
        2,
        3
      );

    This module is nowhere near as stable, mature and well-understoof as
    Data::Dumper; but on the other hand, as it's mostly for use in debugging
    code, and not production code, it's probably stable enough.

  XXX Comptability
    This module also offers an XXX workalike mode, supporting "WWW", "XXX",
    "YYY" and "ZZZ" functions.

      use Data::Dumper::Declare -xxx;
  
      sub greeting {
        my $greeting = 'Hello';
        return WWW($greeting); # prints warning
      }
  
      my $bar = greeting(); # $bar is now "Hello"

  Exports
    Exports only "Dumper" by default. This module uses Sub::Exporter
    allowing you to rename functions quite easily:

      use Data::Dumper::Declare
        Dumper  => { -as => 'DUMP' };
